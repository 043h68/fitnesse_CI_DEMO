FitNesse is an application testing suite that allows you to test the business layer of your application.

It is not a browser automation tool, although there are such tools that work with FitNesse.

It is not a unit testing tool.  The tests that FitNesse runs integrate the various layers of your application together, demonstrating even to non-coders that the application works as designed.

FitNesse provides an easy-to-use [[wiki][http://wiki.org/wiki.cgi?WhatIsWiki]] to create web pages that can be run as tests, along with the ability to run those tests.  The tests can be run not only directly from the page itself, but also from a console application that is suitable for adding to automated build scripts.

The goal is for FitNesse to operate at a level just ''below'' the user interface level, demonstrating that, given various inputs to your application, the correct results are returned.  In a sense, you could consider it an alternative user interface for the application.

So what does the interface look like?  It consists of a series of HTML tables.  Fitnesse understands various formats of tables, and if those formats are not sufficient, developers are welcome to add additional ones.  Generally, the tables take the basic form of a Command cell and some Parameter cells, which are followed by some Output cells.  When a test is run, the command and parameters are evaluated to see if the correct output is given.  [[Here's a quick example][>TwoMinuteExample]] to get you started.

Now, if you're reading this on the web site, you probably found that the Fitnesse Test button in that example didn't work as advertised.  It's been disabled to minimize stress on the site.  But that's ok - since among other things, Fitnesse is a wiki, you can simply download and run it, and read these same web pages as served up by your local system.  When you do that, you'll be able to run the tests.  Why not [[download it now][>DownloadingAndInstallingFitNesse]]?

!3 Creating the Table
Okay, so you saw what Fitnesse can do.  You ran a test with some inputs, checked to make sure the outputs were as expected, and saw how easy it was to determine whether the application worked correctly or not.  Now you'd like to create some tests of your own.  How do you do it?

If you go back and edit the TwoMinuteExample page, you'll see some wiki markup that looks like this: {{{
|eg.Division|
|numerator|denominator|quotient?|
|10       |2          |5        |
|12.6     |3          |4.2      |
|100      |4          |33       |  }}}

The vertical bars delimit table cells. For this table, there is not much more too it than that. You don't have to line up the vertical bars this way; we just do it to make it easier to read.  Go ahead and modify this page a little.  Add some extra rows with some additional numbers to test, or change some of the numbers around.  Then save and run the tests again.  Simple, no?
