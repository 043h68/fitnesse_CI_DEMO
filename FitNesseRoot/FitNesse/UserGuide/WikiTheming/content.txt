(new since April 2012)

As of April 2012, !-FitNesse-! has a new layout. There are a few reasons for making this (incompatible) change:

 * !-FitNesse-! had quite a techie edge to it. The menu items were not well structured and some pages looked messy (like Search)
 * Web standards have evolved, so should !-FitNesse-!
 * Lots of markup was generated directly from java code, now [[Velocity][http://velocity.apache.org]] is performing the rendering
 * !-FitNesse-! was not easy to customize
 * The web interface looked old fashioned. Having a fresh look and feel appeals to people (yes it does)
 * !-FitNesse-! style related files (css, javascript, templates) were put in !-FitNesseRoot-!. This is not desired since it mixes application files with user data (will pages)

So here you are, in your new !-FitNesse-!, with a look and feel you're not accustomed to. How to deal with that?

!2 Theming to the rescue

One of the benefits you'll have from the new layout is that the page L&F is easier to change. FitNesse comes with a few styles built-in:

 * ''fitnesse_straight'' -- the default style
 * ''fitnesse_mint'' -- a classy style
 * ''fitnesse_topnav'' -- a minimalistic style

The default style can be configured through ''plugins.properties'', !-FitNesse-!'s settings file (this is where you also configure custom symbols). Add the line
{{{
Theme=fitnesse_mint
}}}
(re)start !-FitNesse-! and the style completely changed.

!2 Rolling your own

FitNesse still has the ability to support custom user styling. In [[!-FitNesseRoot/files/fitnesse-!][/files/fitnesse]] you can place your own files. Stylesheets go in a ''css'' directory, Javascript under ''javascript'' and images are filed under ''images'' (note: those directories are not present by default, you'll have to create them by hand).

Now say you want to create your own style, named ''my-own''. You'll need to create a stylesheet ''!-FitNesseRoot/files/fitnesse/css/my-own.css-!'' and an optional Javascript file ''!-FitNesseRoot/files/fitnesse/javascript/my-own.js-!''.

The stylesheet fill with your own styling (maybe import one of the default styles and apply your own modifications on top of it).
