|Define table type |
|Bowling | as Table |

The "Define table type" table is designed to help you write more readable tests.

It tells fitnesse what default table type to use for fixtures of a given name. 

By adding a "Define table type" definition to your SetUp page the actual test becomes more readable since this implementation detail can be removed from the test..  

For example, the bowling fixture from TableTable will now run even if the "Table:" is ommitted, as shown below. 

|Bowling|
|3|5|4|/|X||X||3|4|6|/|7|2|3|4|9|-|4|/|3|
||8 ||28||51||68||75||92||101||108||117|||127|
