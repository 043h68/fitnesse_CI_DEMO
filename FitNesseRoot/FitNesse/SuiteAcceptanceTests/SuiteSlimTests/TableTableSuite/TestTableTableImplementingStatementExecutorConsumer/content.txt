!1 Symbol Handling by Fixtures

If you need advanced symbol handling in your fixtures than your fixture code must handle this.
Advanced means that you assign to a symbol a value and need to reference this new value again in the same table.
Think if you really need this as it makes your code more complicated.


!3 Load the symbol aware fixture
|import                                      |
|fitnesse.slim.test.statementexecutorconsumer|
 
!3 Tell the slim agent that the fixture will handle symbols
|script                                        |
|$SLIM_AGENT_FIXTURE_HANDLES_SYMBOLS=|echo|true|

 
 
!include SymbolAssignmentAndReferenceOfTheSameInOneTable


!|script                                        |
|# Disable the fixture symbol handling again    |
|$SLIM_AGENT_FIXTURE_HANDLES_SYMBOLS=|echo|false|

!3 Check the results Z is now 201 :)
!|script                                 |
|check|echo int|$Z                   |201|
|check|echo int|$${RUNNING_PAGE_NAME}|13 |



!3 The fixture handles a chain of assignments 

|script                                        |
|$X=                                 |echo|99  |
|$SLIM_AGENT_FIXTURE_HANDLES_SYMBOLS=|echo|true|

|table: Table Table Inc First Col|
|$X             |$X=             |
|$X             |$X=             |
|$X             |$X=             |
|$X             |$X=             |
|$X             |$X=             |
|$X             |$Y=             |

!4 Warning, also in scripts or other tables symbols are not managed anymore
the below echos not the value but the symbol name 
|script        |
|check|echo|$X||

!|script                                        |
|# Disable the fixture symbol handling again    |
|$SLIM_AGENT_FIXTURE_HANDLES_SYMBOLS=|echo|false|

|script           |
|check|echo|$X|104|
|check|echo|$Y|105|
